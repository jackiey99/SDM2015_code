# *Cheetah*: Fast Graph Kernel Tracking on Dynamic Graphs

## Overview

The package contains the following files:
- as50days.mat: AS dataset
- demo.m: a demo file showing how to do the graph kernel tracking
- updateEigen.m: update low rank approximation of a matrix, see Algorithm 2 in the paper
- myQR.m: partial QR decomposition
- gen\_nrowcol\_perturb.m: generate perturbation matrix
- origininal_kernel.m: the exact graph kernel computation


## Usage
Please refer to demo.m and comments in each file for the detailed information.
